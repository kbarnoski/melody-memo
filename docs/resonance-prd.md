# Resonance (Resonance) -- Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 16, 2026
**Author:** Karel Barnoski

---

## 1. Product Overview

**Resonance** is an AI-powered piano voice memo platform that transforms raw musical recordings into structured, analyzable, and developable musical ideas. Built for pianists who capture ideas at the keyboard, it bridges the gap between "I played something cool" and "I understand what I played and where to take it."

**Core thesis:** Every musical idea deserves to be understood, not just stored.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Pianists and composers capture hundreds of voice memos -- quick recordings of ideas, progressions, fragments. These recordings pile up in phone folders, unnamed and forgotten. The musician knows there's gold in there but has no way to:

- Remember what key they were in or what chords they played
- Find that "jazzy thing from last Tuesday"
- Understand the harmonic structure without sitting back at the piano
- Get intelligent feedback on their ideas
- See patterns across their creative output over time

**Resonance solves this by making every recording self-aware.**

---

## 3. Target User

**Primary:** Pianists who record voice memos of their playing -- hobbyists, singer-songwriters, jazz players, composers, and students who want to capture and develop ideas.

**Secondary:** Music teachers analyzing student recordings; producers reviewing sketch ideas.
